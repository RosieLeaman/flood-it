# flood-it
A version of the flood-it puzzle game in the browser using React. You can try out the game here https://rosieleaman.github.io/flood-it/flood-it.html

Instructions are available on the game page using the "Show instructions" button. 

The game allows you to undo a move if you decide it was bad, and try the same board again if you fail to win the game within 25 moves.
Each board is randomly generated.

Further ideas for the game:
- Allow the player to choose the grid size
- Attempt to estimate a good target number of moves (currently fixed at 25)
